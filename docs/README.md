#PyGSI

As part of the transition to the Unified Forecast System (UFS), the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) software will be replaced with a Unified Data Assimilation (UDA) framework based on the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI). During this work, there has been an emphasis on developing tools using Python to analyze and visualize data. PyGSI is one of now many tools that utilize Python's powerful capabilities to aid in this transition.

Specifically, PyGSI is a collection of tools that read, filter, and plot diagnostic GSI netCDF4 files using Python.
